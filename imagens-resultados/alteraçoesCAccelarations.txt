Here is a text explanation of the changes made to vectorize the code and why:

Removed unnecessary temporary arrays:

    The previous version used temporary arrays a_i and a_j to store accelerations. But this is unnecessary overhead. We can vectorize the updates directly into the main acceleration array a.

Vectorize updates directly into main array:

    Instead of computing the force f and looping over each dimension k, we can directly vectorize the update equation:

    a[i][0] += f rij[0]; a[i][1] += f rij[1]; a[i][2] += f * rij[2];

    Same for particle j, just with a minus sign.

    This allows the multiplication and addition to be done in a vectorized manner, improving performance.

Declare loop variables in innermost scope:

    The loop indices i, j, k are now declared inside the loops rather than globally. This limits their scope and lifetime to what is needed.

Overall, these changes aim to improve the performance by removing unnecessary arrays, vectorizing the math operations into a SIMD-friendly form, and tightening variable scope. The result is cleaner and faster code without sacrificing readability. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
